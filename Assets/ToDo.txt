Waves of enemies - should scale logrithmically in difficulty
    X Each wave has a max time, if the player doesn't clear the wave in that time, the next wave starts and joins them
    X If the player clears the wave faster than the max time, there is a "in between waves" timer that starts the next wave early.

    X Clearing a wave should add a bonus to the blitz timer
    X Preset waves should have a challenge rating, when choosing a wave preset, randomize from all waves in that CR.

Bugs
    Shotgun transparency isn't working (Probably true for blaster as well)
    Sometimes rockets cause explosion in the middle of the screen as well as in the correct loc
    particle should scale with laser size

Boss Mechanics
    moves in and out of screen, locking screenwrap on the side it's on, as well as the opposite side
    2 Lasers that sweep across the screen at an offset, forcing the player to screenwrap
    releases enemies
    after it leaves the screen, it throws rocks at the player from the side it left on
    2 turrets that shoot blasters at the player
        these can be destroyed
    only takes damage at weak points
